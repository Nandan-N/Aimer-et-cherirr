Problem statement - 

According to new education policy, the medium of instruction at least till grade five and preferably till grade eight and beyond, should be the mother tongue or regional language, wherever possible, in both public and private schools. But with estimated 42% of kids already facing language learning problems due to multitude of different problems, This remains a challenging task for many.
Using scientific methods and spatial revision, Our team is enthusiastic to tackle upon the problem of providing a strong community for young students to nurture and grow on their academics and talents in language while helping them gain complete fluency in it.
While the actual process of language learning is rather simple, Lot of learners arent able to realise it due to lack of technique or methedology.
With over *250 million students* at India and over *40 million* of them facing language learning difficulties, we believe that theres lot of potential for us to act on as our own team members are passionate about languages and all of us can speak 4+ languages. 
With this new national education emphasizing on all round development with actual learning with clear conceptual understanding, we aim to achieve that, paving way to a brighter future of the young generation with our educational tool acting as supplementary to the prescribed syllabus.
