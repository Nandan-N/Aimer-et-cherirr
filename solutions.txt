We seek to implement scientific learning approach to language learning including *constant revisions, recalls and reviews*. 
From having various sections from Vocabulary revising to improve word power to quizes to raise your doubts section. 
Our website structure is based on scientificaly supported "Read, Revise Review, Recall and Remember" structure. The learning is structured and divided into small chunks for easier learning. 
We will implement all this while also building a user and kid friendly website to make learning more attractive. We will source our content needed from the ncert supplemented with open linguistics projects.
We are completely confident in implementing a basic version of it within 24 hours and very excited to do so.
